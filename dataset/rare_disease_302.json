Both variants were absent in all public databases including ExAC, gnomAD, and 1000 genomes. The missense variant (p.His83Tyr) was inherited from the father and the splice site variant (g.14,769,868 InsA) from the mother. Sanger sequencing confirmed perfect segregation of the identified variant within the family. In silico analysis revealed the mutant residue is located near a highly conserved position, bigger and more hydrophobic than the wild-type residue, possibly leading to structural issues.\\\"\\n}\""

Histological examination revealed that the epithelium was composed of multilayered columnar epithelium around the pedicle and multilayered squamous epithelium at the apex. The subepithelial stroma was edematous, and structures mimicking bronchial glands were observed. A layer of cartilage formed an inverted U-shape in the stroma, which served as the backbone of the polypoid lesion. Immunostaining revealed epithelial cells positive for TTF-1 around the pedicle, which is characteristic of bronchial epithelium. At the apex, diffuse staining of MUC4 in all layers of the stratified squamous epithelium was observed. The staining pattern of MUC4 was different from that of normal stratified squamous epithelium, in which MUC4 was positive only in the basal cells. The diffuse staining pattern resembled that of squamous metaplasia in the respiratory tract.\\\"\\n}\""

First trimester scans revealed increased nuchal translucency (3.1 mm) and increased nuchal fold thickness (5.3 mm) at 14 weeks. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for common aneuploidies indicated low risk. At 20 weeks, ultrasound showed bilateral short femur length (1.55 cm), tibia (1.28 cm), humerus (1.39 cm), radius (1.56 cm), and ulna (1.59 cm) all greater than 4 SD below the mean. Abdominal circumference was 12.2 cm, head circumference was 17.2 cm, and FL/AC ratio was 0.127 (ratio <0.16 is suggestive of lethal skeletal dysplasia). Bilateral club foot and mild polyhydramnios were present. Long bones appeared broad with minimal bowing in lower limbs. Specific morphological details of hands were not appreciated. Thoracic circumference at the level of cardiac chamber was 12.5 cm, and the ratio of thoracic-abdominal (TC/AC) circumference was 0.93. The elbow joint appeared abnormal although specific details were not ascertained.\\\",\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"Postnatal fetal examination at 20 weeks GA showed the fetus weighed 250g with a head circumference of 17.5 cm, abdominal circumference of 1.5 cm, interpupillary distance of 2.5 cm, and inner canthal distance of 1.5 cm. Facially, the fetus had high forehead, hypertelorism, crease below lower eyelids, depressed broad nasal bridge, anteverted nares, broad nasal base, long thin philtrum, low set ears, small mouth, and microretrognathia. Other external features included short neck, bilateral hitchhiker thumb, bilateral single transverse crease, bilateral club foot (right side more severe than left), left fifth toe curved and dorsiflexed, right foot with increased gap between T1/T2 and T4/T5, and right T5 slightly laterally deviated. Observed were all four short limbs with bowing of lower limbs.\\\",\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"Initial Test Results\\\": \\\"Initial ultrasound scans at 14 weeks GA showed increased nuchal translucency (3.1 mm) and increased nuchal fold thickness (5.3 mm). NIPT for common aneuploidies reported low risk.\\\",\\n  \\\"Further Diagnostic Tests\\\": \\\"Fetal MRI at 20 weeks confirmed short limbed fetus with slightly bowed long bones in lower limbs and short long bones in upper limbs; both elbow joints were deformed with poor outline of distal humerus. CNS, spine, and abdominal viscera were normal. Estimated total lung volume was 24.8 mL with an O/E ratio of total lung volume of 1.6. Genomic DNA extraction and sequencing of the fetus and parents identified a previously unreported homozygous 2 bp duplication in exon 2 of the IMPAD1 gene (c.473_474dup; p.(Thr159*)). The variant caused a frameshift leading to premature truncation of the IMPAD1 protein at amino acid 159. This variant was in a heterozygous state in both parents.Postmortem Radiographic Evaluation: Confirmed short long bones (< 4SD) with symmetrical involvement of proximal, middle, and distal bones, showing minimal bowing. Both distal humeri were deformed with a broad proximal end and minimal sclerosis. Clavicles appeared thick with an abrupt angle at the junction of the middle and outer third. Scapulae were stout and rounded. Bilateral subluxation of elbow joints was observed. Hands showed bilateral hitch-hiker thumb deformity with broad and short phalanges. Right great toe had excessive outward angulation. No fractures were noted. Skull bones were normal. Decreased vertebral height globally, small vertebral bodies in the lumbar region, and absent vertebral bodies in the upper cervical region were observed. A hemivertebra was present at D5. The thoracic cage was normal. The pelvic bones were horizontally oriented ileum. Growth cartilage showed focal cystic degenerative changes and separation of chondroblastic columns with vacuolated cytoplasm and occasional cytoplasmic inclusions.Genetic Analysis: Sequencing using ABI 3130 Genetic analyzer of the DTDST gene did not reveal any clinically significant variant. Whole exome sequencing using Agilent Sureselect clinical research exome V2 capture kit on Illumina HiSeq2000 identified a homozygous 2 bp duplication in exon 2 of the IMPAD1 gene, causing a frameshift mutation (c.473_474dup; p.(Thr159*)) leading to premature truncation of the protein. The variant was absent in population databases (1000 genomes, gnomAD) and in-house databases. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.Histological Examination: Hematoxylin\\u2013eosin staining of the growth cartilage showed focal cystic degenerative changes and separation of chondroblastic columns, with chondrocytes displaying vacuolated cytoplasm and occasional inclusions. Alcian blue staining revealed markedly less intense staining at pH 1 compared to pH 2.5, indicating reduced sulfated glycosaminoglycans.\\\"\\n}\""

Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed extensive ossifications of the muscles including the right latissimus dorsi, left scalene, bilateral pectoralis, bilateral external oblique abdominal, right iliacus, bilateral gluteal, left adductor, and left hamstring. There was also involvement of the subcutaneous tissues of the right upper back and left lower quadrant of the abdomen, left posterior sacral region, bilateral hips, and along the fascia superficial to the erector spinae muscles, extending to the skin, with no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. No abnormal ossifications were seen in the bony structures. Trio-clinical exome sequencing of the proband and both biological parents revealed a novel de novo heterozygous, likely pathogenic variant in the FAM111B (c.1462delT, p.Cys488Valfs*21) in the proband. There was no evidence for a rare sequence variant in the protein-coding regions or splice-site junctions of the GNAS or ACVR1 despite full sequence coverage. The sequence change in FAM111B deletes one nucleotide in exon 4 of the FAM111B (NM_198947.3:c.1462delT), causing a frameshift at codon 488. The new reading frame ends in a stop codon, 21 positions downstream, and is expected to replace the C-terminal portion of the FAM111B with 21 alternative amino acids. This variant is absent from large population studies (Genome Aggregation Database, gnomAD). 3D protein modeling further ascertains how this mutation might affect protein structure and function. Models of the wild-type and c.1462delT sequences of FAM111B were built using I-TASSER. Sequence analysis predicted the resulting Cys488 might be a crucial residue in the potential zinc-binding site. Zinc is essential for numerous processes including protein structural support and enzyme catalysis. Zinc has been shown to inhibit the activity of cysteine proteases, suggesting that alteration of this site alone would cause hyperactivity of the enzymatic portion of FAM111B. Models of other pathogenic variants, including p.Arg626Gly, p.Try621Asp, and p.Ser628Asn, showed that the overall protein structure appeared minimally disrupted, but the area around the putative zinc-binding site was altered. In the p.Cys488Valfs*21 frameshift model, normal predicted folding could not occur, the zinc-binding domain was eliminated, and the overall truncated, N-terminal protein structure was significantly altered.\\\"\\n}\""

Q199Hfs*2) (NM_000642), inherited from the mother, causing the glutamine at position 199 to change to histidine, leading to the insertion of a stop codon at position 200. Furthermore, the heterozygous deletion of exon 13 found by WES was also a previously unreported variant, which was inherited from the father. qRT-PCR results showed that the relative copy number of exon 13 in the control and the patient\\u2019s mother were normal, while the proband and the father had half of the normal copy number, confirming the absence of exon 13. This deletion causes deletions of amino acids from position 538 to 578, leading to the termination of transcription at the 540th amino acid. Both variants in the AGL gene could cause the early termination of gene transcription. The patient inherited both variants, becoming a compound heterozygote.\\\"\\n}\""

The image also showed enlarged perimedullary vessels in the posterior epidural region, with hyperintense signal voids in T1 and a hypointense signal in T2 sequences. A spinal DSA was subsequently performed, which revealed a right perimedullary fistula type I, with a feeding artery of the radiculopial branch and a perimedullary venous drainage of the segmental artery of the right L2. The fistula was satisfactorily embolized with a 20% histoacryl-lipiodol emulsion.\\\"\\n}\""

The second variant was a novel missense mutation in Exon 5 corresponding to the 344th base of the cDNA (c344G>A), resulting in a change of the 115th arginine to glutamine in the protein. This was a variant of uncertain significance as per ACMG classification. Docking studies of the ligand (PROTOPORPHYRIN IX CONTAINING FE) showed reduced binding affinity in the mutant version compared to the wild type.

Additional liver ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase and delayed wash-out in the delayed phase. No systemic metastasis was found initially. Pathological examination after right hemihepatectomy revealed a multinodular solid mass, measuring 9.0 \\u00d7 8.0 \\u00d7 6.0 cm. The mass was well-demarcated, yellow-whitish, soft, and firm with multifocal necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor consisted of poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (20%) and large- and small-cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) (80%) components. The tumor invaded the right anterior portal vein and microvessels. There was no lymph node metastasis. Immunohistochemically, chromogranin and synaptophysin were positive in the areas of NEC and negative in the areas of HCC.

Her birth weight was 1.9 kg, head circumference 32 cm, and length 40 cm. At 15 hours of age, she experienced high blood pressure (104/70) and was found to have a significant heart murmur. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly, suggesting patent ductus arteriosus. Despite treatment with fluid restriction, increased positive end-expiratory pressure, Lasix, and two doses of hydralazine, her condition worsened, leading to a diagnosis of congenital heart failure. At nine weeks of age, she was managed with digoxin, diuretics, and ventilation for congenital heart failure of unknown cause and had difficulty controlling hypertension. At 10 months, she presented with a puffy eye and high blood pressure (130/85), squint on the right eye corrected by surgery, restricted joint movement, bilateral infantile polycystic kidney disease, and renal resistant hypertension.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a slow posterior dominant rhythm, with diffuse background slowing and occasional bursts of polymorphic delta waves with higher amplitude over the right hemisphere with independent bitemporal polymorphic slowing.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Further Diagnostic Tests\\\": \\\"CT angiogram showed part of the upper abdominal aorta with incidental finding of filling defect. The study was extended to include the aorta and lower extremities, which showed significant aortic thrombosis below the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) level with the involvement of the left renal artery with infarction of the lower and mid poles of the left kidney. The thrombus extended down to the iliac arteries, with a resumption of blood flow in the femoral arteries through two collateral blood supplies. Imaging showed diffuse osteopenia in hand radiographs and several vertebral compression fractures and osteopenia. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan showed low bone mineral density (BMD), with lumbar spine Z-scores of -1.7, femoral neck Z score of -2.3, and hip Z-score of -2.2. Homocysteine levels were extremely elevated at >500 \\u00b5mol/L (reference range <10 \\u00b5mol/L). Fasting homocysteine levels were elevated at 106 umol/l (reference < 1 umol/L) and fasting methionine levels were elevated at 170 umol/l (reference 16-34 umol/l). Family members (sister and mother) were screened with homocysteine and methionine measurements, and both had normal levels. Serial measurements of amino acid levels showed improvement of initially low serine levels, increase in taurine and \\u00df-aminoisobutyric acid. Amino acids from the urea cycle were affected during treatment. Levels of the myokine beta-aminoisobutyric acid increased over two years of follow-up.\\\"\\n}\""

Bilateral lower extremity erythema and edema were also noted.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"The patient has a history of traumatic spinal cord injury causing paraplegia.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Initial Test Results\\\": \\\"Complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell count at the upper limit of normal with lymphopenia and a normocytic anemia. A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) showed a slight elevation in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 79 mm/h and 342 mg/L, respectively. Urinalysis revealed moderately elevated leukocytes and trace ketones. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2 was negative. A venous duplex exam was negative. An electrocardiogram and chest X-rays were unremarkable. Repeat laboratory testing showed a new leukocytosis, markedly elevated CRP and ESR, and more pronounced elevations in AST, ALT, and ALP.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Further Diagnostic Tests\\\": \\\"Additional tests were performed for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, Rickettsia rickettsii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Lyme disease, parvovirus, toxoplasmosis, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). All were negative, except for EBV Viral Capsid Antigen IgG and EBV Nuclear Antigen IgG antibody, likely reflective of past infection. Convalescent Ehrlichia and Rickettsia serological tests were ordered along with galactose-\\u03b1-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) IgE serology. The acute Ehrlichia serology and acute Rickettsia serology were originally non-reactive with both titers measured at < 1:64 during the hospital stay. Convalescent serology, ordered 28 days after the acute sample collection, showed a greater than four-fold increase in the Ehrlichia IgG titer (1:256).\\\"\\n}\""

Analysis of the PTEN gene showed a likely pathogenic c.801 + 2T>A variant. The c.801 + 2T>A variant is considered as 'likely pathogenic' according to the American College of Medical Genetics, because it is located at the splice donor site of intron 7 (PVS1). It is a very rare variant that is not registered in The Genome Aggregation Database in the general population, including in Japanese (PM2), but is registered as 'pathogenic' in ClinVar. Primers were designed for exons 5 to 8 to cover exon 7, and splicing defects were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. Messenger RNA (mRNAs) lacking exon 7 were detected. mRNAs having a cryptic exon as part of the intron 6 sequence and mRNAs produced by splicing with a new donor site at 'GT' 74 nucleotides downstream from the mutation site were also detected. Both of these splicing aberrations cause a frameshift that stops PTEN protein synthesis. These mRNAs were degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In addition, deletion of exons 6 and 7 results in the synthesis of proteins with deletions from glycine 165 to lysine 267. These results suggested that alleles with these variants were unlikely to produce normal PTENs.\\\"\\n}\""

The shortening of the long bones, narrowing of the chest with short ribs, bowing of the femur, excess soft tissues on the thighs and lower legs, suspicion of retrognathia, and ulnar deviation of the wrist were noted on an ultrasound at 14 weeks of gestation plus 6 days. Skeletal dysplasia with poor prognosis was suspected, with a probable diagnosis of type 1 thanatophoric dysplasia. Amniocentesis and FGFR3 gene sequencing or next-generation sequencing using a panel for skeletal dysplasias were proposed. After obtaining the patient\\u2019s informed consent, the amniocentesis under ultrasound guidance was performed at 15 weeks of gestation. At the 17th week of gestation, another ultrasound scan was performed to visualize the abnormal sulcation of the temporal lobes and further detail the phenotype. The observed sulcation pattern was normal. The ultrasound findings from the previous scan were generally confirmed; additional findings included bilateral brachydactyly of the hands, mild polyhydramnios, moderate pericardial effusion, a small hydrothorax, and mild retrognathia without signs of the Pierre\\u2013Robin sequence.

The shortening of the long bones, narrowing of the chest with short ribs, bowing of the femur, excess soft tissues on the thighs and lower legs, suspicion of retrognathia, and ulnar deviation of the wrist were noted on an ultrasound at 14 weeks of gestation plus 6 days. Skeletal dysplasia with poor prognosis was suspected, with a probable diagnosis of type 1 thanatophoric dysplasia. Amniocentesis and FGFR3 gene sequencing or next-generation sequencing using a panel for skeletal dysplasias were proposed. After obtaining the patient\\u2019s informed consent, the amniocentesis under ultrasound guidance was performed at 15 weeks of gestation. At the 17th week of gestation, another ultrasound scan was performed to visualize the abnormal sulcation of the temporal lobes and further detail the phenotype. The observed sulcation pattern was normal. The ultrasound findings from the previous scan were generally confirmed; additional findings included bilateral brachydactyly of the hands, mild polyhydramnios, moderate pericardial effusion, a small hydrothorax, and mild retrognathia without signs of the Pierre\\u2013Robin sequence.

Four months later, she developed angina due to a 70% intrastent restenosis, which was treated with a drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. A year later, the DES was reoccluded, necessitating a balloon angioplasty. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was recommended after testing for aspirin and clopidogrel response. At age 13, the patient was admitted for fatigue, weight loss, and persistent headache. She had no pulse in her axillary, brachial, and radial arteries, a blood pressure difference of over 30 mmHg between upper limbs, and vascular bruits confirmed during auscultation of her carotid, subclavian, and renal arteries. She displayed no inflammatory syndrome. After ruling out infectious, congenital, or miscellaneous diseases, the diagnosis of Takayasu was established according to pediatric TA classification criteria. Due to the severity of vessel involvement, an aortic bicarotid bypass with Gore-Tex was performed at her juvenile age. Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (six cycles of intravenous treatment followed by oral administration) were initiated but later disrupted because of apparent disease remission.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"At age 13, the patient had no pulse in her axillary, brachial, and radial arteries.

Radiography of the limbs revealed femur bowing, an underdeveloped acetabulum, and a femoral head. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed ovaries, a small uterus, and shortened vagina. Hormone analysis showed increased testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. A peripheral blood karyotype reported a 46XY with a positive SRY gene.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Further Diagnostic Tests\\\": \\\"Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed Arnold\\u2013Chiari malformation type 1. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on the mother, father, and patient. The sequencing identified 1,582 variants causing non-synonymous, stop-gain, and frameshift changes. After filtering, one nonsense heterozygote variant in the SOX9 gene of the patient was detected. The pathogenic variant was caused by a guanine to adenine change at the 344 bp (c.G344A), resulting in a tryptophan to a premature stop codon change at position 115 (p.Trp115*) of the HMG domain. The frequency of this variant was 0 in the Genome Aggregation Database and Exome Aggregation Consortium databases and was not reported in the Ensembl genome and ClinVar databases. The parents did not have the nonsense variant and were homozygous for the reference allele (G).\\\"\\n}\""

Exercise stress echocardiogram did not induce ischaemia, arrhythmia, or a significant LVOT gradient, but an apparent shunt across the ventricular septum was noted. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) demonstrated a large calibre first septal perforating artery extending to the endocardial border of the LVOT, with probable communication with the LV cavity, and a ventricular septal defect was excluded. Invasive angiography confirmed a fistula between an unroofed first septal perforator and the LV cavity. Adenosine myocardial perfusion scan demonstrated septal post-surgical wall motion changes and an ejection fraction (EF) of 59%, with no evidence of myocardial ischaemia to suggest a steal phenomenon. Inpatient telemetry demonstrated incidental runs of asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Given the lack of symptom-rhythm correlation between ventricular tachycardia and presyncope, fludrocortisone was initiated for recurrent presyncope due to orthostatic hypotension, resulting in symptomatic improvement.\\\",\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"Heart rate was 63\\u2005b.p.m. and blood pressure 106/70\\u2005mmHg, with evidence of orthostatic hypotension (standing blood pressure 86/57\\u2005mmHg). There was a loud systolic murmur heard at the left sternal edge, radiating to the carotid arteries, with no significant augmentation with dynamic manoeuvres and no clinical signs of heart failure.\\\",\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"History of surgical myectomy for HOCM, renal transplant for end-stage renal failure secondary to reflux nephropathy, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.\\\",\\n  \\\"Initial Test Results\\\": \\\"Pre-myectomy resting echocardiogram demonstrated severe dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (85\\u2005mmHg at rest and 140\\u2005mmHg on Valsalva) associated with increased septal thickness (18\\u2005mm) and significant mitral valve systolic anterior motion resulting in moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Left and right ventricular volumes and ejection fraction (EF 55%) were normal. Pre-myectomy exercise stress echocardiography was electrically and symptomatically negative for inducible ischaemia, but showed evidence of severe dynamic intracavity obstruction post-exercise and moderate-severe dynamic mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant coronary system with type II left anterior descending artery and non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Post-surgical resting echocardiography demonstrated a significant reduction in LVOT gradient (now 5\\u2005mmHg).\\\",\\n  \\\"Further Diagnostic Tests\\\": \\\"Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) demonstrated a large calibre first septal perforating artery extending to the endocardial border of the LVOT and probable communication with the LV cavity.

Further analysis identified a homozygous missense variant c.1324G > A in exon 8 of the GUSB gene on chromosome 7, causing a single amino acid substitution (p. Ala442Thr). This variant was not included in the HGMD, Clinvar, ExAC, gnomAD, or the 1000 Genomes database. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the variant to be deleterious. Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of this GUSB gene variant. Sanger sequencing of DNA from the previous edema fetus also revealed the presence of this mutation.\\\"\\n}\""

The expression of EBV was negative in the tumor mass and the cells in the peripheral vessels. There was clonal rearrangement for the IG detection using specific BIOMED-2 primers based on peripheral blood sample. Sanger sequence confirmed that it was IGHV3-33_06. The homologous degree was 100% compared with the germline sequence. PCR-based TCR assay revealed a small monoclonal T-cell population in a background of oligoclonal T-cells. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using haematopoietic and lymphoid specific panels covering the coding sequence (CDS) of 143 Hematological Disease genes. The NGS results showed pathogenic hotspot mutations of STAT5B (c.1924A>C, p.N642H) and DNMT3A (c.2678G>A, p.W893*), as well as several likely pathogenic mutations and variants of uncertain clinical significance in various genes.\\\"\\n}\""

Initially, the patient experienced seizures without any discernible trigger presenting in three primary forms. Seizure type 1 (focal aware autonomic seizures) includes tightness in the chest, palpitations, and flushing of the cheeks without any loss of awareness, lasting for tens of seconds and occurring several times a day. Seizure type 2 (focal impaired awareness behavior arrest seizures) built on type 1 symptoms, adding impaired responsiveness, blank staring, interruption of ongoing activities, dropping objects, loss of awareness, reddening of the eyes, right hand dystonia, and oral automatisms, lasting for dozens of seconds to a minute and occurring 5-6 times a year. Seizure type 3 (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures) built on type 2 symptoms and included head and eye version, tonic and clonic movements of the limbs, foaming at the mouth, loss of awareness, without tongue biting or incontinence, lasting tens of seconds and occurring once a year. The patient has been taking lamotrigine and valproic acid regularly for approximately 5 years, but seizure type 1 and seizure type 2 are still not well controlled. On EEG, interictal period recordings showed slow spike-wave discharges originated from bilateral temporal lobes, and ictal period recordings included focal impaired awareness behavior and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, with discharges originating from the left temporal-occipital junction and generalizing to the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. SEEG registered discharges mainly from heterotopic nodes in the left occipital lobe, temporal-occipital junctions (both left and right), right superior temporal gyrus, and the middle temporal gyrus posterior during the interictal period. Ictal onset was registered from the left temporal-occipital junction heterotopic nodes. RF-TC was chosen due to the diffuse distribution of heterotopic gray matter nodes in both hemispheres. Post-coagulation SEEG registered a significant reduction in epileptiform discharges during the interictal period. The patient continues taking lamotrigine and valproic acid regularly.

Initially, the patient experienced seizures without any discernible trigger presenting in three primary forms. Seizure type 1 (focal aware autonomic seizures) includes tightness in the chest, palpitations, and flushing of the cheeks without any loss of awareness, lasting for tens of seconds and occurring several times a day. Seizure type 2 (focal impaired awareness behavior arrest seizures) built on type 1 symptoms, adding impaired responsiveness, blank staring, interruption of ongoing activities, dropping objects, loss of awareness, reddening of the eyes, right hand dystonia, and oral automatisms, lasting for dozens of seconds to a minute and occurring 5-6 times a year. Seizure type 3 (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures) built on type 2 symptoms and included head and eye version, tonic and clonic movements of the limbs, foaming at the mouth, loss of awareness, without tongue biting or incontinence, lasting tens of seconds and occurring once a year. The patient has been taking lamotrigine and valproic acid regularly for approximately 5 years, but seizure type 1 and seizure type 2 are still not well controlled. On EEG, interictal period recordings showed slow spike-wave discharges originated from bilateral temporal lobes, and ictal period recordings included focal impaired awareness behavior and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, with discharges originating from the left temporal-occipital junction and generalizing to the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. SEEG registered discharges mainly from heterotopic nodes in the left occipital lobe, temporal-occipital junctions (both left and right), right superior temporal gyrus, and the middle temporal gyrus posterior during the interictal period. Ictal onset was registered from the left temporal-occipital junction heterotopic nodes. RF-TC was chosen due to the diffuse distribution of heterotopic gray matter nodes in both hemispheres. Post-coagulation SEEG registered a significant reduction in epileptiform discharges during the interictal period. The patient continues taking lamotrigine and valproic acid regularly. Follow-up showed occasional epileptiform discharges in bilateral temporal lobes during the interictal period after 2 months, and only one focal impaired awareness behavior arrest seizure at 11 months follow-up due to stopping medication without permission.

Genetic testing via next-generation sequencing identified a c.3019_3020del variant in exon 15 of the PCNT gene, predicted to lead to a premature codon termination. Initial brain MRI at diagnosis showed areas of gliosis with encephalomalacia, diffused hypo/delayed myelination, irregularity of the subependymal surface, thinned corpus callosum, dilation of the lateral ventricles, thinned appearance of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, and trigonocephaly. At age 8, another MRI conducted after a stroke showed multiple aneurysms in various cerebral arteries, occlusion of the M1 segment of both middle cerebral arteries, and irregular and stenotic appearance of the A3-A4 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries associated with Moyamoya disease.\\\"\\n}\""

The volume of the visible tumor was 0.53 cm\\u00b3 in CT and MR imaging, which resulted in a planning target volume (PTV) of 0.97 cm\\u00b3. A GRS treatment planning system was utilized to place isocenter coordinates inside the PTV. A total of 459 non-coplanar candidate beams of different diameters were targeted at the isocenter coordinates. The final plan used six isocenters (three with the 10 mm and three with the 7.5 mm apertures) and 140 beams to cover 99.2% of the PTV with 21 Gy at the 54% isodose line.\\\"\\n}\""

The birth weight and length were 1680 g and 42 cm, respectively.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Clinical Presentation\\\": \\\"The infant was born due to severe oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index: 2.8 cm) on prenatal ultrasound. A prenatal ultrasound at 23 weeks of gestation demonstrated multicystic kidneys. There was no obvious amniotic fluid at delivery. The placenta and umbilical cord were normal. There was no deformity. Apgar scores were 10 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min of age. The baby developed respiratory distress approximately 10 min after delivery. At 15 min of life, the oxygen saturation acutely decreased from 90 to 50%, and the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Pulmonary surfactant was intratracheally aspirated. The infant experienced repeated severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia. He had episodic oxygen desaturation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's repeated hypoxemia and white lung on chest radiographs persisted after 3 rounds of pulmonary surfactant therapy. The infant's urine output was significantly diminished, with a total urine volume of 35 ml from birth to the end of life. Abdominal X-rays indicated little aeration of the abdominal bowel, wherein the colon was not aerated, and there was no fetal fecal discharge at any time. At 1 day 10 h of life, the infant made a difficult respiratory effort with little chest movement, and his parents elected to withdraw ventilatory support.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"Physical examination indicated continuous machine-like murmurs and hepatomegaly. The cyanosis and labored breathing of the infant under invasive ventilator-assisted ventilation improved and oxygen saturation gradually increased, but levels could not be maintained in the normal range. After replacing the oscillating ventilator with auxiliary ventilation, the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation increased to the normal range and was maintained at 93\\u201395%.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"This was the couple's second pregnancy.

            "Follow-up Presentation": "\"{\\n  \\\"Basic Information\\\": \\\"A male infant was born prematurely at 32+4 weeks of gestation by cesarean section. The mother was 22 years of age, and the father was 27 years of age. The couple was nonconsanguineous and of Chinese origin, from Ya'an, Sichuan Province, China. The birth weight and length were 1680 g and 42 cm, respectively.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Clinical Presentation\\\": \\\"The infant was born due to severe oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index: 2.8 cm) on prenatal ultrasound. A prenatal ultrasound at 23 weeks of gestation demonstrated multicystic kidneys. There was no obvious amniotic fluid at delivery. The placenta and umbilical cord were normal. There was no deformity. Apgar scores were 10 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min of age. The baby developed respiratory distress approximately 10 min after delivery. At 15 min of life, the oxygen saturation acutely decreased from 90 to 50%, and the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Pulmonary surfactant was intratracheally aspirated. The infant experienced repeated severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia. He had episodic oxygen desaturation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's repeated hypoxemia and white lung on chest radiographs persisted after 3 rounds of pulmonary surfactant therapy. The infant's urine output was significantly diminished, with a total urine volume of 35 ml from birth to the end of life. Abdominal X-rays indicated little aeration of the abdominal bowel, wherein the colon was not aerated, and there was no fetal fecal discharge at any time. At 1 day 10 h of life, the infant made a difficult respiratory effort with little chest movement, and his parents elected to withdraw ventilatory support.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"Physical examination indicated continuous machine-like murmurs and hepatomegaly. The cyanosis and labored breathing of the infant under invasive ventilator-assisted ventilation improved and oxygen saturation gradually increased, but levels could not be maintained in the normal range. After replacing the oscillating ventilator with auxiliary ventilation, the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation increased to the normal range and was maintained at 93\\u201395%.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"This was the couple's second pregnancy. There was no history of prenatal exposure to alcohol, drugs, or medications. The couple's first child was delivered at 28 weeks after prenatal ultrasound suggested bilateral renal cysts and severe oligohydramnios.

Ultrasound showed that the bilateral ureters were not dilated and that the bladder was not filled. Ultrasound showed an enlarged pancreas with uneven parenchymal echogenicity enhancement. The head and tail of the pancreas contained two cysts, the larger located in the head measuring 1.2 cm \\u00d7 1.5 cm and the smaller located in the tail measuring 0.6 cm \\u00d7 0.4 cm. Abdominal ultrasound showed uneven liver echogenicity, no intrahepatic bile duct dilation, and no gallbladder and spleen abnormalities. Echocardiography showed pulmonary hypertension, minor pulmonary valve regurgitation, patent ductus arteriosus, and an inner diameter of pulmonary artery end of 3.9 mm. CDFI showed detectable biphasic bidirectional regurgitation, atrial septal defect (2.2 mm) with patent foramen ovale, mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF: 43.5%, LVFS: 19%). The cardiac position, myocardial echogenicity, and thickness were normal. The cranial ultrasound was normal. The chest ultrasound showed bilateral pleural effusion (left 1.3 cm, right 0.3 cm). Multiple abdominal X-rays showed little abdominal bowel inflation and an absence of colon inflation. Whole Exome Sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous pathogenic variant in the NPHP3 gene on chromosome 3, a nonsense mutation in exon 12 (NM_153240.5: c.1761G > A, p. W587*) and a frameshift mutation in exon 1 (NM_153240.5: c.69delC: p. Gly24Ala24*11).

He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) 1 g/day for 3 days and continued with prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day and methotrexate 15 mg/weekly. Despite a decrease in CK serum levels from 28,457 to 21,671 IU/L, the patient began to experience proximal muscle weakness of both lower limbs, which worsened after a second monthly IVMP (500 mg/day for two days), with sparing of the upper limbs. Based on CK serum levels, the onset of proximal lower limb weakness after corticosteroid treatment, and the prominent inflammatory changes seen on muscle biopsy, methotrexate and glucocorticoid treatment was suspended.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"Neuromuscular and systemic examination was normal. No cardiac or respiratory complications were found.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"There was no history of familial neuromuscular disorder or parental consanguinity or of exposure to myotoxic medications or substances.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Initial Test Results\\\": \\\"Initial CK levels were 26,372 IU/L. Myositis-specific (Mi2, TIF1g, MDA5, NXP2, SAE1, Jo1, SRP, PL7, PL12, EJ, OJ), myositis-associated (Ku, PM-Scl 75/100, Ro52), and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Thyroid-stimulating hormone level was normal. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies were initially normal. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis detected no DMD deletions.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Further Diagnostic Tests\\\": \\\"Muscle biopsy from the right quadriceps showed necrosis along with endomysial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and no fibrosis or fatty infiltration was seen. A new EMG and nerve conduction studies revealed a myopathic pattern. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) confirmed the diagnosis of LGMDR2 based on a compound heterozygous variant of the DYSF gene. The first mutation was c.3851C > T, which causes a Gln \\u2192Ter amino acid change at position 1160 (p.Q1160X), leading to a stop codon in exon 32. The other mutation was a c.5979dup in exon 53, which causes a p.Glu1994ArgX3 frame shift. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the mother was a c.3851C > T carrier and that the father had the c.5979dup mutation.\\\"\\n}\""

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast revealed abnormal enhancement and thickening of the pituitary infundibulum and stalk. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed multifocal nodular hepatic steatosis and hepatomegaly without any focal liver abnormality; in addition, multiple indeterminate bony lesions were read as non-specific focal sclerosis and cystic lesions. A bone marrow biopsy showed 40% cellularity and reactive marrow changes without any blasts or infiltrate.

A few grunting episodes were noted on the first day of life but resolved spontaneously. She was being breastfed every 3-4 hours since birth without difficulty. At 30 hours of age, 2 hours after the last feeding, she became unresponsive, resulting in resuscitation efforts by neonatology and pediatric cardiology. Continuous cardiac monitoring showed a pattern of wide QRS complexes with peaked T waves refractory to intervention. Resuscitation efforts were discontinued after 2 hours. Newborn screening blood spot samples had been collected approximately 6 hours prior to the cardiac arrest. The newborn screen report was received 2 days after the infant died and indicated elevated levels of C14, C14:1, C14:2, C14:1/C12:1, and C14:1/C16.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"An echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities. Postmortem examination revealed a structurally normal heart without hypertrophy, evidence of meconium aspiration on examination of the lungs, early ischemic changes in the stomach, renal tubular vacuolization, and microsteatosis of the liver. Examination of the placenta was notable for rare pigmented macrophages concerning for meconium present in utero.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"The infant was born following an uncomplicated pregnancy. There was no reported family history of medical conditions.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Initial Test Results\\\": \\\"Initial venous blood obtained after 1 hour of resuscitation showed pH 7.002 with a base deficit of 10.

            "Initial Presentation": "\"{\\n  \\\"Basic Information\\\": \\\"The patient is a 27-year-old pregnant Caucasian woman (gravida 2, para 1) at 28 weeks of pregnancy when referred to the medical center. The fetus was male.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Clinical Presentation\\\": \\\"The patient was referred due to the presence of megacystis and bilateral hydronephrosis on routine ultrasound at 28 weeks of pregnancy. Previous ultrasound examinations at 20 and 24 weeks' gestational age were completely normal. At 29 (6/7d) weeks of gestation, significant fetal ascites with an elevated diaphragm and thoracic compression were observed. Oligohydramnios was present with an Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) of 2.7 cm. Urinary tract evaluation showed significant bladder wall thickening (6.2 mm) but the resolution of previously observed megacystis and hydronephrosis, suggesting a spontaneous bladder rupture with the onset of urinary ascites. The patient was admitted for cardiotocography (CTG) fetal monitoring, initiation of corticosteroid therapy for fetal pulmonary maturation, and further work-up. Initially, a minimal invasive approach was chosen. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided fetal ascites puncture was performed with the aspiration of 420 ml of fluid, followed by amnio-infusion of 250 ml. At 30 (4/7d) weeks, increasing fetal abdominal circumference with persistent ascites and oligohydramnios were observed. Fetal Doppler ultrasound showed a decreased venous return with presence of pulsative flow in the inferior vena cava and a continuous elevated fetal heart rate between 150 and 170 beats per minute, leading to cardiac decompensation. Due to these cardiovascular changes, repeat ascites drainage and peritoneo-amniotic shunt placement were performed. At 34 (6/7d) weeks, relapse of the megacystis was observed with bilateral pyelectasis and oligohydramnios (AFI 2.4 cm), possibly due to healing of the bladder rupture, after which elective cesarean section was planned. The male infant was born weighing 2370 g with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively, and there was no need for supportive measures. A 6 Fr transurethral bladder catheter was placed with drainage of 90 ml of urine, and amoxicillin uroprophylaxis was initiated. Exploratory surgery was performed to remove the prolapsed intra-abdominal tissue (part of omentum) and the peritoneo-amniotic shunt. The abdominal wall defect was closed. At 1 month of age, cystoscopy and resection were performed. Follow-up showed resolution of hydronephrosis and gradual decrease of bladder wall thickening over the following months. At 3 months of age, uroprophylaxis was changed to nitrofurantoin. At 12 months, uroprophylaxis was terminated. The patient has been followed up for 8 years, showing normal ultrasonographic findings and renal function. However, bladder dysfunction has been reported, manifesting as overactive bladder with daytime urinary incontinence, low bladder capacity and nocturnal enuresis. Standard urotherapy was initiated with limited result. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was started as a second line treatment. Anticholinergic therapy (oxybutynin, 2.5 mg two times daily) showed better results with resolution of the urinary incontinence. Currently, anticholinergic treatment is still ongoing and dose de-escalation is planned.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Physical Examination\\\": \\\"The renal parenchyma appeared normal on ultrasound at 29 (6/7d) weeks of gestation. Inspection of the peritoneo-amniotic shunt after birth showed prolapse of intra-abdominal tissue, which was found to be a part of omentum during exploratory surgery.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Past Medical History\\\": \\\"The family history revealed a sister with a horseshoe kidney and a nephew with unilateral pyelectasis.\\\",\\n\\n  \\\"Initial Test Results\\\": \\\"Analysis of the urinary ascites showed a normal male karyotype and a \\u03b2-2-microglobulin value of 2.1 mg/L, indicating good renal prognosis. Fetal ultrasonography one day post-operatively showed no residual ascites, correct stent position, absence of hydronephrosis, and normalization of the AFI to 10.8 cm. Cystography performed 1 week after birth confirmed a right-sided grade I vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR). At 6 months, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and Cr-ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA) study showed normal kidneys with symmetrical function and good absolute renal clearance of 71.9 ml/minute/1.73 m2. At 12 months, repeat cystography showed minimal residual gr I VUR on the right side. A repeat Cr-EDTA study at three years showed normal renal clearance of 151 ml/minute/1.73 m2.\\\"\\n}\"",
