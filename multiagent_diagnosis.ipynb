A two-old-girl was admitted to Tianjin Childrenâ€™s Hospital due to progressive enlargement of the abdomen resulting from hepatomegaly. The parents of the patient are non-consanguineous.  Laboratory examinations revealed nocturnal fasting hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, significantly elevated levels of transaminases. Hepatomegaly was confirmed with abdominal ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography enhanced scan. However, electromyography excluded myopathy, cardiomyopathy was ruled out by electrocardiogram and echocardiography, and physical examination showed no obvious growth retardation.\n",

It was confirmed by fetal MRI at 36 weeks' gestation which showed an occipital meningocele measuring 11 mm Ã— 27 mm Ã— 16 mm. There was ventriculomegaly noted all along. Antenatal karyotyping and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of amniotic cells were normal. Postnatally, she was stable at birth and did not require mechanical ventilation. Her MRI brain showed a 20 mm Ã— 18 mm Ã— 25 mm cystic lesion at midline of occipital region while operation with excision of this meningocele was performed on day 6 of life. There was a small bony defect (<5 mm) with narrow pedicle connecting the lesion. The content of the meningocele was gel-like and no normal brain tissue. Her clinical condition was monitored regularly while she had no sign of raised intracranial pressure after surgery. At 1 year of age, she had another cystic lesion at the retrocerebellar region as shown on a follow-up MRI scan without other clinical signs. Posterior fossa craniotomy for cyst fenestration was performed at 16 months of age without any complications. She has no further intracranial cystic lesions developed and no hydrocephalus with generally normal development. She also had bilateral severe myopia since infancy requiring corrective glasses. Currently the severity of myopia was around âˆ’14.00D bilaterally. Retina on both eyes were thinning with indirect barrier laser treatment performed while no retinal detachment was noted so far. She can read at close proximity and write down her name in Chinese and English properly. The patients' parents reported her daily function was adjusted despite severe myopia. Her head circumference increased from 25th centile at birth to around 50th centile at 7 years old. Her development and cognitive assessment were normal at 7 years old.\n"

The temperature rose to as high as 40.3Â°C on the 2nd day. Empirical anti-infective treatment with cefotaxime (1.0 g q6h) was applied to the patient. 48 h later, observation on the temperature showed a constant fever over 40.0Â°C.

    "Here is a patient case for analysis, provide the final diagnosis, final differential diagnosis and recommended tests. A 13-year-old boy presented to our emergency department with complaint of recurrent fever for more than 1 month. He was born in a non-consanguineous family without history of Caroliâ€™s disease. The first fever occurred without obvious causes in early September 2021, and the maximum temperature reached 39.0Â°C accompanied by headache. He was treated with anti-infective treatment in the community clinic for 4 days. Then the temperature returned to the normal range. Two weeks later, the patient got a fever above 39.0Â°C again, and the intervals was gradually shortened. To seek for further treatment, he went to the peopleâ€™s hospital of the local city. The temperature returned to normal after 5 days of treatment with ceftriaxone and methylprednisolone for septicemia. However, no further examination was made to determine the cause of fever. The night before coming to our hospital, the boy had a higher temperature once again. Finally, he was brought to our hospital, a provincial tertiary childrenâ€™s hospital. During the course of illness, he had poor appetite and sleep. After excluding the possibility of COVID-19, he was admitted to the department of infectious disease. A physical examination was remarkable for mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no rebound tenderness. Besides, the liver and spleen were palpable 4.0 cm under the ribs. The laboratory results after admission were shown in Supplementary Table 1. Due to the previous medication in primary hospital, the levels of inflammatory biomarkers showed just a slight increase, while the coagulation, liver function and tumor markers were in the normal range.\n",

    "Based on the clinical presentation of recurrent fever, abdominal tenderness, and hepatosplenomegaly, the final diagnosis for this 13-year-old boy is not yet clear, but several differential diagnoses can be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Differential Diagnosis:\n",
    "1. Infectious diseases - Given the recurrent fever and response to antibiotics, bacterial infections such as bacterial endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscess, or other localized infections should be considered. Viral infections like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) could also present with similar symptoms.\n",
    "2. Autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders - Conditions such as familial Mediterranean fever, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or other rheumatological diseases could present with recurrent fever and abdominal pain.\n",
    "3. Malignancies - Lymphoma or leukemia can present with recurrent fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly.\n",
    "4. Liver diseases - Caroliâ€™s disease or other hepatobiliary diseases could cause recurrent fevers and abdominal pain, although the patient has no family history of Caroliâ€™s disease.\n",
    "5. Other causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) - This could include granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis, or less common infections like tuberculosis or brucellosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Tests:\n",
    "1. Blood cultures - To identify any bacterial pathogens that may be causing sepsis.\n",
    "2. Serological tests - For EBV, CMV, and other viral infections that can cause similar symptoms.\n",
    "3. Imaging studies - Abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan to evaluate for intra-abdominal abscess, hepatosplenomegaly, and liver pathology.\n",
    "4. Rheumatological workup - Including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and other relevant autoimmune markers.\n",
    "5. Hematological evaluation - Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow biopsy if indicated to rule out malignancies.\n",
    "6. Tuberculosis testing - A tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), and chest X-ray to rule out tuberculosis.\n",
    "7. Liver function tests - To monitor liver function and evaluate for hepatobiliary diseases.\n",
    "8. Echocardiogram - To rule out bacterial endocarditis, especially if there is any history of heart murmurs or congenital heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The management of this patient will depend on the results of these investigations. It is important to continue monitoring his temperature, inflammatory markers, and organ function while awaiting diagnostic results. If the fever persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, further evaluation for non-infectious causes of fever should be pursued.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Doctor2 (to chat_manager):\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation of recurrent fever, abdominal tenderness, and hepatosplenomegaly in a 13-year-old boy, along with the history of poor appetite and sleep, suggests a need for a thorough investigation to determine the underlying cause. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Differential Diagnosis:\n",
    "1. Infectious diseases - Recurrent fever and abdominal tenderness could suggest an intra-abdominal abscess, liver abscess, or other localized infections. Conditions such as typhoid fever, hepatitis, or other systemic infections should also be considered.\n",
    "2. Autoinflammatory or autoimmune disorders - Conditions such as familial Mediterranean fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis could present with recurrent fever and abdominal pain.\n",
    "3. Malignancies - Lymphoma, leukemia, or other neoplasms could present with recurrent fevers and hepatosplenomegaly.\n",
    "4. Hepatobiliary diseases - Given the abdominal tenderness and hepatosplenomegaly, conditions affecting the liver and biliary system, including Caroliâ€™s disease, should be considered despite the lack of family history.\n",
    "5. Other causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) - This could include granulomatous diseases, rheumatological conditions, or less common infectious diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Tests:\n",
    "1. Blood cultures - To identify any bacterial pathogens that may be causing sepsis or localized infection.\n",
    "2. Serological tests - For common infectious agents such as EBV, CMV, hepatitis viruses, and other pathogens that can cause similar symptoms.\n",
    "3. Imaging studies - An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to evaluate for intra-abdominal abscesses, liver pathology, or other structural abnormalities.\n",
    "4. Rheumatological workup - Including tests for ANA, RF, and other relevant autoimmune markers.\n",
    "5. Hematological evaluation - CBC with differential, peripheral blood smear, and possibly bone marrow biopsy if there is suspicion of hematological malignancy.\n",
    "6. Tuberculosis testing - Considering the endemic region, tests for tuberculosis such as TST, IGRA, and chest X-ray should be considered.\n",
    "7. Liver function tests - To assess liver function and investigate potential hepatobiliary diseases.\n",
    "8. Echocardiogram - To rule out endocarditis, particularly if there is any heart murmur or other cardiac findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the persistence of fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and the worsening abdominal tenderness, it is crucial to expand the diagnostic workup to include non-infectious causes and to consider a possible inflammatory or neoplastic process. A multidisciplinary approach involving infectious disease specialists, rheumatologists, hematologists, and gastroenterologists may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate management.\n",
