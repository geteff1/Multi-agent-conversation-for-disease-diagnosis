# Multi-agent-conversation-for-disease-diagnosis

**Introduction**

This repository presents a novel multi-agent conversation framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diagnosing complex diseases. Our approach, structured under the Autogen framework, allows for in-depth conversations among LLMs, paving the way for more accurate and nuanced disease diagnosis.

**Preprint Article**

Our work has been documented in a preprint article titled "One is Not Enough: Multi-Agent Conversation Framework Enhances Rare Disease Diagnostic Capabilities of Large Language Models". For more insights into our study, please visit: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3757148/v1

**Data curation of 150 rare disease cases**
Each case was curated as primary consultation and follow-up consultation to test the effectiveness of LLMs in actual clincial scenarios.

**Python Script**

The repository contains Python scripts required to set up and run the framework. The basic requirements include Python and access to large language models through an API. For detailed instructions, see the script documentation.

**Runtime Estimate**

The estimated time to run a single case using our framework is approximately 5-10 minutes, varying slightly based on system specifications and network conditions.

**Demo**

Explore our demo section to see case presentations illustrating the application of our framework in real-world scenarios.

**Reproduction**

In the reproduction section, you can find detailed information on various diseases processed using our framework, offering insights into its practical applications.
Getting Started

To get started with our framework, please follow the steps outlined in the Python script section. Ensure you meet all the basic requirements before attempting to run the scripts.
